# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System is a web application designed to facilitate efficient patient management within a hospital. This application allows administrators to perform key operations such as adding, updating, and deleting patient records, along with monitoring their COVID-19 status. Built with Spring Boot for the backend and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend, the system ensures seamless data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## Features

- **COVID-19 Status Updates:** Update and monitor the COVID-19 status of patients for timely healthcare decisions.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly web interface for convenient data input and interaction.

## Technologies Used
